Today, many great ideas are created and technologies are built that solve our day to day problems. However, many ideas go unheard of and their related problems unsolved, because the ones who think of them lack the skills and connections to make them happen. ScratchPaper is a place where thinkers and creators come together to collaborate on ideas and bring them to life.

Users can collaborate on their latest ideas and gather support, incentivizing developers to bring these ideas to life.
