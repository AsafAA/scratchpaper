            <p> Today, developers are solving many of the problems they see in their respective industry, however, so many more problems with large user bases are left unsolved as individuals with new solutions to these problems lack the resources and support to get these problems noticed and solved. We aim to provide the bridge by creating a platform that allows individuals of different backgrounds to unveil their ideas to the broader community. Our solution will allow the uploader to track the community response to their idea from the level of interest to the progress being made and for the maker an area to log development, find collaborators, and garner feedback on their prototypes. People constantly come up with ideas that would make their lives better, but these ideas are never developed because they donâ€™t reach the eyes of those who can make them. We aim to connect new ideas with people who can bring them to life. When somebody has an idea for something they would like to see, they simply post their idea on our dashboard. Others who share an interest in the idea and would love to see it exist can follow the idea and be notified of the progress being made on it. Developers looking to build useful products can search through this endless stream of ideas, and when an idea that really peeks their interest comes up, they can put themselves down as developers. The more support an idea gets, the more incentive developers will have of building it, because there will already be a user base of people waiting to use it. As developers, we know that people like us are constantly looking for their next big project, and we aim to help developers find that idea by bringing it right to them, along with base of interested users and a tool to collaborate on this idea as they make progress.</p>
